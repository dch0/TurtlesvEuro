My first genetic algorithm, turned in for a grade February 2019

Though the algo was not profitable and I dont expect to improve the results without a major overhaul, I may clean up the funtions of this model and try to use it to apply multiprocessing and better utilize the class methods if I do not get the opportunity in a future project to practice these things.
